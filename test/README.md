# Testing ORIS

Manual way to test ORIS is to load data into ORIS and run the *automatic prediction module*. 
The *automatic prediction module* executes all the methods implemented in ORIS for finding origin of replication sequences.
The results can further be validated for model genomes by looking up the annotations or published experimental results.

Data for few well annotated genomes is provided in this directory.
